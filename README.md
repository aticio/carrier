Also a base project for my golang examples.

You can find examples of:

* Basic microservice structure
* gRPC usage with increased data size
* Concurrency - check out Carrier service
* A two way service (accepting REST - requesting with gRPC) - check out Explorer service
* Scheduled operations - check out Carrier service

* Sending data through kafka - check out Carrier service
* CRUD operations on mongodb - check out Seed service
* Real time config changes (Viper)
